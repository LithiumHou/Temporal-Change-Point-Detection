# Temporal-Change-Point-Detection

Temporal Change-point Detection

Usage: download all the folders and run with MATLAB.

Run prediction and detection/main.m for a 30-dim Lorenz model as an example (don't need to change the parameter settings). The prediction results are produced and saved. Then run myBOCDtest.py for the following BOCD algorithm to accurately detect the change points.
For the bionetwork data, please view the bionet folder and load bionetrecord.mat as the input data. To make accurate prediction, run main.m with changes in parameters(see bionetregression.m for details)
